- R Studio
- R Studio Packages


## Features
- 1. Create Box Plot Graph with Medal and GDP of the Countries
- 2. Create a Bar Graph with Medal Count and Country Population
- 3. Create a Graph with whatever to features you want to get insights


## Setup
You need to have R Studio and the following R packages downloaded:
- dplyr
- reshape2
- xml2


## Usage
You can use the code to get the merged dataset of the Olympic information and webscraped country information. You can then use it to analyze whatever you would like. You can use the Descriptive Analysis R code as an example of how you can use the data. You can then change the features to what you would like to learn. 

1. First download everything in the GitHub. 
2. Then run the merged data r script and then the web scraped file. 
3. Finally run the descriptive analysis and use the files however you would like. 


## Project Status
